          <h1>Astronote</h1>
          <p>This app solves schrodinger's equations for electron probability density in a hydrogen-like atom, for any valid set of quantum numbers, at runtime. I implemented all of the necessary mathematical functions for this, such as legendre and laguerre polynonomials, in C# in unity (which I had never used before), so that I could integrate the Vuforia toolkit and some existing volume-tracing code (which I customized heavily to render transparency and color gradients as well as preform better on mobile GPUs) to actually render the wavefuntions as an augmented reality, translucent object that one can look around and handle (using a printed tracking target).</p>
