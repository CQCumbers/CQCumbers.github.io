Built in 48 hours for the Ludum Dare 43 compo, Body Smasher is a puzzle platformer with the theme "Sacrifices must be made". This was my first time making a video game, and I had a lot of fun figuring out how to create pixel art tiles, compose background music, and design thoughtful levels under the strict time limit. Body Smasher was written in Wren for the TIC-80 fantasy console, a platform with high level scripting support but the color palette, file size, sound channel, and other technical limitations of 8-bit retro computers. It helped me learn to work within the constraints of less powerful hardware as well as balance programming with all the other tasks needed to make a game.
