Strobr is an iOS app that uses variable framerate imaging to measure the frequency of a cyclical process, for example the speed of a spinning car wheel. Traditionally, these frequencies are measured with stroboscopes, devices that combine persistence of vision with flashing lights. By changing the frequency of flashes until it looks like the car wheel stays still, you can measure the wheel's speed. Strobr works similarly, but you change the imaging framerate instead, allowing you to measure more diverse processes, more conveniently. Two friends and I built Strobr in 36 hours at Pennapps Fall 2017, where it won top 30. We had a lot of fun while learning about Swift programming, iOS APIs, and high framerate imaging.

I came up with the idea for a camera based stroboscope while brainstorming right after the opening ceremony of Pennapps Fall 2017. Lincoln and Lachlan wanted to build a stroboscope after seeing William Osman's youtube video about them. I had recently seen the Slow Mo Guys behind the scenes video explaning high speed camera operation and frame rates, so after hearing about what a stroboscope was, I thought it would be much easier to "strobe" the camera shutter rather than strobing the lights. We were then able to find an apple API that allowed apps to dynamically set the video framerate and exposure time, which turned it into the easiest idea to implement that we could think of then. I unfortunately had to leave before we could start implementing things, as I had an ACT test in the middle of the hackathon (apparently I'm not great at scheduling things). When I came back, they had already implemented the dynamic frame rates, RPM display, and gesture controls. In the end, I added some code to increase the range of usable framerates, improves image brightness, and continuously autofocus, as well as polished the UI and added a help screen. We got into the top 30 in the first round of demos, but our judge in the top 30 was Quora founder Charlie Cheever, and I'm not sure he got the usefulness of the app - probably not helped by the fact that all we had to demo it with was an MLH sticker taped to a motor.
