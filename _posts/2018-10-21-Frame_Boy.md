Frame Boy emulates early model Game Boy (DMG) hardware in the browser using C++ and webassembly. Though I had created a Chip8 emulator before, the Game Boy’s PPU, stereo audio, memory banking, and other features made for a significant jump in complexity, necessitating better code organization and performance. I had to learn about topics from static analysis and cache efficiency to signal decimation and the emscripten toolchain - not to mention the complexities of Game Boy hardware, which is often surprisingly poorly documented. Though there are many faster and more accurate game boy emulators out there, I can’t imagine a more engaging way to learn the inner workings of computers than emulating one yourself.
