This emulator was built in Swift Playgrounds and replicates the functionality of the Chip8, a virtual CPU. It works by reading byte-level instructions (1's and 0's) intended for a specific piece of hardware and replicating their effects in code. These instructions are simple tasks like moving a number from memory (RAM) to a register in the CPU or adding a number to the value of a register. It also emulates two timers, an input keypad, and a black and white display. This was my first time implementing an emulator as well as my first time using Swift. I appreciate how Playgrounds allows users to poke at CPU internals like register state, memory state, and current opcode in real time, which eases debugging. Building it was a great way learn Swift development and understand how CPUs work at the machine code level.
