This project replicates the functionality of the Chip8, a simple virtual computer. Like most emulators, it reads machine codes, 1s and 0s that encode simple tasks like adding 2 numbers, and replicates their effects using a higher level language - in this case, Swift. This emulator also uses mac APIs to replicate the Chip8's timers, keypad, and black-and-white display. While the Chip8 is simple, emulating it quickly enough is still difficult for Swift Playgrounds, which encouraged me to learn ways of improving efficiency. Overall, this project was a useful, hands-on way to understand CPUs and learn how to write higher performance code.
