Conceived as a way to allow more people to check on rocket engine hotfire tests, MASA Dashboard provides a flexible solution to real time data visualization, without all the complexity of a time series database and grafana plugins. It is well suited to projects where you need more than a serial monitor, but not a whole IoT system - just constantly update a CSV with your data and MASA Dashboard will create a web accessible interface with draggable panels and several configurable graph types. Building it was a good exercise in UI design, structuring React apps, and writing server side javascript.
