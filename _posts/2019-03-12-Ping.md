Inspired by the game Apex Legends, Ping is an iOS app that lets you notify your friends about specific real-world locations using context-sensitive messages. Tap a location on the map and Ping will give you a list of canned messages - like "Mexican Food here!" or "Mozambique here!" - using reverse geocoding and Mapbox's point of interest data.  You can then send a rich push notification to your squadmates including an address and map of the location. Ping includes Auth0-based signup and squad management functionality, and helped me learn more about authentication, push notifications, and geocoding.
