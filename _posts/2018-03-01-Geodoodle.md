Geodoodle is an augmented reality game inspired by redditâ€™s r/place. Like in r/place, you can only place one pixel at a time on a large canvas, so players must work together to create pixel art images. In Geodoodle, however, the canvas covers the entire globe, and you have to be in a particular location to place a pixel there. This encourages players to explore their local area and collaborate with neighbors to create an ever-changing piece of digital art. Originally built for Pennapps Spring 2018, the current Geodoodle app is written in Swift using Mapbox and Auth0 (earlier versions used React Native or Cordova), while the backend uses aiohttp, Socket.io, and Postgres. Through Geodoodle, I learned how to build cross platform apps, work with mapping software and geohashes, and write asynchronous backend servers.
