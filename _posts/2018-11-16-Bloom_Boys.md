This project was built together with 4 other students for my first year college engineering class. It was designed to monitor dissolved oxygen at various depths, and detect algal blooms or lake turnover near a drinking water intake. Building it was a challenge in many ways, but especially in debugging the communications between the microcontroller and peripherals, as we found that problems could be anything from faulty hardware and incorrect wiring to typos in the code. Testing it in the field was also educational, as we struggled with broken wires, insufficient waterproofing, and incompatible power cables in the cold. We made a lot of mistakes, but in the process learned many valuable lessons about building field-ready embedded systems.
