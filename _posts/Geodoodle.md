Geodoodle is a collaborative map-based pixel art game inspired by reddit's r/place. It is similar in that each person can only place one pixel at a time on a large canvas, and so must work together to create pixel art images. However, in Geodoodle you must be at a particular physical location within a city in order to place a pixel there. This makes it more of an augmented reality game, encouraging exploration of your local area and collaboration with neighbors. Through it I learned about building cross platform apps, working with mapping software and geolocation data, and writing high-preformance websockets servers.
