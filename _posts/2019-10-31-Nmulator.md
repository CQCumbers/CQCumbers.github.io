nmulator is a work-in-progress Nintendo 64 emulator for PCs, which currently boots a decent number of commercial games. Internally, it consists of a dynamic recompiler that translates N64 CPU and RSP instructions into x86 for the host CPU, and a vulkan compute shader that processes RDP commands on the host GPU. SSE4 is used to emulate the RSP's vector coprocessor instructions. Building nmulator was a valuable experience in reverse engineering real-world software, implementing and optimizing JITs, using SIMD instructions to improve performance, and understanding both older fixed-function rasterization pipelines and modern GPU compute. Along the way, I also learned the value of building debugging tools like gdb servers, and of writing readable documentation for yourself and others.
