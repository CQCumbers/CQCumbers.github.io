Grifbot seeks to imitate Grif, a character from the show *Red vs. Blue*, with a deep learning language model - specifically, a character-level recurrent neural network trained on hundreds of scripts from the show. By running facebook messages through this model, Grifbot can generate in-character responses that, while usually incoherent, can be entertaining nevertheless. Grifbot was built with Python and Keras, and deployed on DigitalOcean. Building it was a fun way to apply deep learning to a real data set and learn about the challenges of deploying models in the cloud.

This was a fun recent project for actually putting into use my recently acquired knowledge of building recurrent neural networks. While I had had fun practicing the use of convolutional image classification models on past kaggle competitions, I wanted to make something real, and had just learned the basics of recurrent neural networks and LSTMs. A very cool demo I had seen used character embeddings to vectorize the works of Neitschze, and a recurrent network to predict more text character by character (based on a hidden state built up using the preceding 64 characters). Inspired by this, I built a very similar model in Keras and Python, and used it to predict, character by character, dialogue from the popular internet show red vs blue (the scripts for which I had scraped from an online wiki). I then integrated this into a simple flask app that seeded my deep learning model with messages from facebook messenger, and returned the predicted responses from a certain character in the show (grif). This allows fans to pretend to interact with this character as if he were on facebook, and to receive in-character responses to their messages to him. By feeding a hidden vector created through predicting the previous character back into the network on its next run, it can incorporate knowledge about the past in its prediction.
