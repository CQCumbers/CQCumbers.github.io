CSS Tetris uses the space-toggler hack, a way of expressing logical ANDs and ORs using certain properties of CSS3 variables, to implement a limited version of the Quest for Tetris processor, and thus provide an extremely impractical way for someone with a great deal of patience to (theoretically) play Tetris in the browser. It includes 142 bytes of RAM, 10 opcodes, and 3 addressing modes. It also showcases a fundamental limitation to the Turing completeness of CSS - there is no way to automatically feed the outputs back into the inputs, so all state between cycles must be stored in HTML through human input, in this via lots of checkboxes and labels. While impractical to run, it was a very interesting challenge in logic design, and helped me better understand both CSS variables and CPU design.
