Another fun project with deep learning, this time considerably more complicated. I used a pokemon card api to get the names, attack and ability text, and other attributes of almost all english pokemon cards ever made. I then preprocessed this structured data into a custom compact text representation, and used another custom character-level recurrent neural net to predict new cards based on this data set. The compact text representation generated was then decoded and turned into a mockup of an actual card, complete with art generated by a second neural network. The art neural network is a deep regret analytic generative adversarial network, implemented from scratch in Keras based on the description given in the paper "How to Train Your DRAGAN". This kind of network trains two halves - a generator and a discriminator - so the discriminator tries to accurately identify real vs generated images, and the generator tries to generate images that the discriminator classifies as real. The two components must be carefully kept in equilibrium so generated images improve, but the discriminator still knows the direction to optimize in. The DRAGAN gradient penalty makes this somewhat easier in terms of hyperparameter tweaking but was difficult to implement correctly and troubleshoot. Due to the use of Keras, a high level framework, training was very, very slow, but eventually generated somewhat usable images after several weeks of training and troubleshooting.
